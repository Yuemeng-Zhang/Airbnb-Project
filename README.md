# Airbnb-Project

- Project Goal

Airbnb Distribution Project
When Airbnb decides to expand to a new city, it is crucial to gain insights into the Airbnb Distribution Pattern to perfect budgeting and advertising strategies in that city. Therefore, our team aims to analyze relevant factors that impact airbnbâ€™s spatial distribution and build prediction and classification models. We picked three representative cities on the East Coast, New York, Boston and Washington D.C., for our investigation.

- Project Summary

The overall logic of this project is to first construct an initial dataset, then conduct the feature engineering to select a subset of key features as input of models, finally build up prediction and classification models with the best performances by applying various machine learning algorithms.
